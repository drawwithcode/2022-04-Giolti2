# Magna Doodle
This repository is the starting point of the assignments given in the elective course [Creative Coding at Politecnico di Milano](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=696598&__pj0=0&__pj1=3ed8420c42c849845b5caa3de626e8fc).

I've recreated the popular Magna Doodle whiteboard toy for kids from the '70s using p5.

Click or drag your fingers to draw, slide the bottom slider to erase, but be careful not to shake the board too much!
